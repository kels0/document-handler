  <h2>Hello! I hope you like this application!</h2>
  <p>This was made in Angular 4 with the help of Angular cli.</p>
  <p>The application is written in Typescript, Less and HTML.</p>
  <p>For style I used Bootstrap 3.</p>
  <p>The "small" server is written in Nodejs and is for getting the data from SMHI API.</p>

  <p>The entire application is done by me David Falk.</p>

  <p>Here is some good links to read more on the software I used</p>
